# Advanced Favicons
## Introduction
Advanced Favicons is a third party IPS application that handles the tedious and deceptively complex task of generating favicons for your IPS community website.

**What do you mean "deceptively complex"?**

When many people think favicons, they think of a single favicon.ico file that is located in the root of your web directory. In truth, favicons today have morphed into a giant, unstandardized and convoluted mess that involves needing ***more than 25*** different variations of the same favicon image along with multiple schema documents for full compatability accross all browsers and devices.

You *really* don't want to have to create all of these images and files yourself, do you?

I hope not. Advanced Favicons to the rescue then!

This application will handle the mundane and complex task of generating all of these files for you in an easy, step by step process. All you need to do is upload a single, high quality logo image that you wish to use as your favicons base image, answer a few basic questions about how you'd like your site to be displayed on mobile devices, and you're done!

## Setup and configuration

First, install the application in your AdminCP by uploading the included .tar file in the Applications page, located under the System tab.

After the application has been installed, navigate to the Manage Favicons page, located under the Customization tab.

From this page, launch the Setup Wizard and follow the on-screen prompts. That's it! Once you've completed the setup, you'll be given a link which you can use to ensure the application is working correctly.

**Note:** Due to a current bug with the RealFaviconGenerator website, you will be told that your site is missing some iOS and Windows 8/10 images, when this is not the case. You can load these images directly yourself to confirm nothing is wrong here.
